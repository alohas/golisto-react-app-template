# Golisto React App Template

This project is a template that replicates a piece of the real Golisto React App structure.
The intended purpose of this template is letting potential interns, learn the structure in a lite-wight and safe environment.

## Getting started

Golisto uses yarn, so all commands in this file will reflect that.

To get started, simply install the packages with the following command:

```
yarn install
```

And then you're ready to start the project with the following command:

```
yarn start
```

## Project structure

The structure borrows heavily from the final structure of the now deprecated [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit).

### Legend

- Any `index.jsx` file without a description will have only one job: "Export all the components from the folder, that the rest of the app needs to know about"
- Any `<Name>.scss` file without a description, will contain all the styles of the `.jsx` file with the same name, and is imported by that same `.jsx` file. This is also always optional.

## Naming

### Files

Generally all files and folders are named using:

```
camelCase
```

However, folders containing React components, React component `.jsx` files, and their companion `.scss` files are named using:

```
PascalCase
```

Another special case are Sass part files that should not be used directly, but only ever imported. In accordance to the Scss spec, these files should be prefixed with an `_`, and named using:

```
_camelCase
```

### JavaScript

#### Variables

```javascript
let camelCase = 0
```

#### Constants

```javascript
const SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE = 0
```

One may wish to make something akin to an enum, in such case it would be named as such:

```javascript
const PascalCase = {
  SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE: 0,
}
```

#### Functions

Casing for functions are the same as for variables, but we believe that modern IDEs quickly eases any confusion.

```javascript
function camelCase() {}
```

```javascript
const camelCase = () => {}
```

#### Classes & Functional components

```javascript
class PascalCase {}
```

```javascript
function PascalCase() {}
```

### Sass

#### Ids

```scss
#PascalCase {
}
```

#### Classes

```scss
.kebab-case {
}
```

#### Variables

```scss
$camelCase: 0;
```

## Editor

I strongly suggest using VS Code or a compatible editor, so you can make use of the snippets and suggested extensions.
